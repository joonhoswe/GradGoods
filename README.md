Dorm shopping, every incoming freshman's favorite holiday. The time where you can buy everything in your favorite color and style, no hand-me-downs from your siblings, and best of all, it's all on mom's credit card. However, this time of the year has deterimental impacts on our planet.

Every year, over 640 pounds of waste are trashed by college students that are moving out. That's equivalent to nearly 10 bags of cement or a grand piano. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), back-to-college spending is nearly $1,400 per student. These are astounding numbers, and when multiplied by the over 18 million college students present in the U.S., the severity of this problem becomes quickly apparent. 

GradGoods aims to solve this issue by providing a centralized platform for college students both moving in and out of dorms, to securely and quickly buy and sell dorm essentials.
